- 👋 Hi, I’m Ifeoluwa Pelumi Olushola (@iamifeolushola).
- 👀 I’m interested in FrontEnd Web Development and Community Management.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to design solutions to problems (with bash, c, python, javascript, CSS, PHP, MySQL, Solidity, and HTML).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that solve many problems holding back the human mind & abilities to live their best lives. Bullish on blockchain!
- 📫 You can reach me on Twitter (@iamifeolushola).
