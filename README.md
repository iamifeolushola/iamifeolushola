- 👋 Hi, I’m Ifeoluwa Pelumi Olushola (@iamifeolushola).
- 👀 I’m interested in FrontEnd Web Development, Web3, and OS Community Management.
- 🌱 I’m learning to design solutions to problems (with python, javascript, CSS, Solidity, and HTML).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that solve many problems holding back the human mind & abilities to live their best lives. Bullish on the blockchain!
